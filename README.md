This repository contains whatever vision code we wrote using [GRIP](https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP), a pseudo-IDE thing that makes computer vision less of a figure-out-how-to-use-this-API problem and more of a logic problem.

To install GRIP, clone the repo and then run installer.exe.
